Social Impact Bonds - a quick hack to predict the impact of SIBs based on council spending history.

Sadly, limited by spending data available, and the fact that there is apparently no standard reporting format for council spending. This severely limits what inferences can be automated. One would have uniquely examine each council's spending to determine what categories of suppliers they have used in the past and what impact the council's activities have had on their area.
